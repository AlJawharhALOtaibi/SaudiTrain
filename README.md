## Project Milestones:

1. **Comprehend the system and construct an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram:**

2. **Creating Database using Postgres:**
   - Execute the following command: `CREATE DATABASE sauditrain;`

3. **Creating Project in Xcode using Vapor:**
   - Generate the project with: `vapor new SaudiTrain`
   - Linking to the Database through the **configure** page:

   - Build required tables as **Models**. In our case, we have three tables.
   
4. **Implementing Item Addition in Tables:**
   - Create `prepare` and `revert` or each table.

5. **Implementing Item Addition via Postman:**
   - Use **Postman** as a networking tool to add items. 
   - Generate controllers to enable functionality, creating root and APIs for each.
 
6. **Visualizing Database with Added Items:**
   - Utilize **Postico** to visualize the database with the added items. <img width="939" alt="image" src="https://github.com/AlJawharhALOtaibi/SaudiTrain/assets/87391133/ae34bb2b-82e2-46f6-984b-e1b695b434c6">
